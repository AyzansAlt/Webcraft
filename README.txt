Discraft allows you to access Discord via an in-game web display, defeating the 
need to have discord open externally on a Web Browser or Client. This means that 
you can open Discord in-game, log-in and message/chat with others as you would 
with any other discord-friendly platform.

Discraft includes a modified version of the handy web-browser library known as 
MCEF (Minecraft ChromiumEF) which allows for in-game web-browsing and 
page-rendering. This has made it possible for Discraft to initialize Discord 
in-game without flaw.
