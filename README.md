Discraft allows you to access Discord via an in-game web display, defeating the 
need to have discord open externally on a Web Browser or Client. This means that 
you can open Discord in-game, log-in and message/chat with others as you would 
with any other discord-friendly platform.

Discraft includes a modified version of the handy web-browser library known as 
MCEF (Minecraft ChromiumEF) which allows for in-game web-browsing and 
page-rendering. This has made it possible for Discraft to initialize Discord 
in-game without flaw.

Required Libraries:
  - Discord-RPC
  - Gson (2.8.1+)
  - Jsonbeans (0.7+)
  - Kryo (2.24.0+)
  - Kryonet (2.22.0-RC1+)
  - minlog (1.2+)
  - Objenesis (2.1+)
